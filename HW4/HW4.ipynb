During training, a dropout layer looks at each input unit and randomly decide if it will be dropped (set to zero) with some given probability $p$. The decision for each unit is made independently. Formally, given an input of shape $N \\times K$ (where $N$ is the number of data points and $K$ is the number of features), it samples from $\\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ for each unit, resulting in an output where approximately $pNK$ of the units are zero (in expectation). This forces the network to learn more robust and generalizable features, since it cannot rely too much on any particular input. During inference, the dropout layer is turned off, and the full network is used to make predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in an extra tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practitioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in an extra tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the extra tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probability of reaching a split on feature A in an extra tree trained on a dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on feature A will result in a high feature importance value for feature A. This could mean feature A is a very important feature for predicting the probability of the target label. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on feature B in an extra tree and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on feature B will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean feature B is not a very informative feature for predicting the target label. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.ExtraTreeClassifier to a dataset automatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the extra tree and stores these values in a **feature_importances\\_** variable.

They are similar to feedforward networks, but have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing information from previous steps to influence the current processing step. This looping mechanism enables Simple RNNs to capture dependencies over time, which is especially useful for tasks involving language, where the context of earlier words or characters affects the final prediction.\n",

    "Simple RNNs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem when performing backpropagation through time. This issue arises because the gradients are repeatedly multiplied by the weight matrix as they propagate through each time step. If the weights are small, these multiplications cause the gradients to decrease exponentially, effectively \"vanishing\" as they travel backward, while large weights can lead to gradient \"explosion.\" As a result, the network struggles to learn and retain long-term dependencies, meaning that early inputs in a sequence are gradually \"forgotten,\" and training becomes ineffective for tasks requiring the processing of lengthy sequences.\n",

The memory cell pathway solves the vanishing gradient problem by providing a direct route for gradients to propagate backwards through time steps without being repeatedly multiplied by small numbers that would cause them to vanish. The gating mechanisms ensure this pathway remains relatively stable while still allowing the network to selectively update its memory when needed.\n",

    "#### Loading the text\n",
    "- We'll use Shakespeare's Macbeth from Project Gutenberg\n",
    "- The text is first standardized by:\n",
    "  - Converting to lowercase for consistency\n",
    "  - Standardizing line endings and spacing\n",
    "- This standardized text is referred to as the 'corpus' - our primary dataset for training and inference\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Character-to-Index Mapping\n",
    "   - Neural networks can't process raw text, so we need to convert characters to numbers. \n",
    "   - First, we find all the unique characters in our text (including alphabets and special characters like spaces and punctuations). This forms our vocabulary, whose size we call the vocabulary size\n",
    "   - Each character in the vocabulary receives a unique integer assignment using the default ASCII value\n",

    "   - We use this mapping to convert the vector of text into a vector of numerical values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "##### Index Representation\n",
    "   - You might be thinking that assigning numbers to letters based on alphabetical order seems rather arbitrary - and you'd be absolutely right! This is precisely why we need smarter index representations\n",
    "   - Using raw indices (like 1, 2, 3) implies an ordering and magnitude that doesn't exist\n",
    "   - For example, 'b' (2) is not \"twice as much\" as 'a' (1)\n",
    "   - We need a more sophisticated way to represent characters that avoids these misleading numerical relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "      a) **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert index to binary vector\n",
    "        - Each index becomes a vector of zeros with a single 1 at the index of the character's value/index\n",
    "        - Example: \n",
    "          - index 1 ('a') → [0,1,0,0,...,0] (length 40)\n",
    "          - index 5 ('e') → [0,0,0,0,1,0,...,0] (length 40)\n",
    "        - Sparse (mostly zeros)\n",
    "        - No relationship between characters (both vowels 'a' and 'e' are completely different vectors)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      b) **Embeddings**: Convert index to learned dense vector\n",
    "        - Each character's index gets transformed into a list of numbers (a dense vector)\n",
    "        - Think of it like assigning each character a unique point a higher dimension coordinate plane\n",
    "        - The motivation is that we can position similar characters close to each other and transform discrete data like letters or words into a continous vector space that the model can use to make predictions from\n",
    "        - What makes embedding layers special is that they're learnable! The model figures out the best way to represent characters based on your specific data and task\n",
    "        - This is super useful since what makes characters \"similar\" changes between tasks - the model learns what similarity means for your specific case and groups characters accordingly\n",
    "        - The embedding layer's dimension parameter determines how many numbers we use to represent each character (the size of the vector space)\n",
    "        - Let's look at a real example with embedding dimension 4:\n",
    "          - The letter 'a' might become → [0.2, -0.5, 0.1, 0.8]\n",
    "          - The letter 'e' might become → [0.3, -0.4, 0.2, 0.7]\n",
    "        - In this example, model discovered that 'a' and 'e' are both vowels and represents them close to each other\n",
    "        - Additionally, embeddings are more memory efficient because they are dense (non-sparse) unlike one-hot vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For our model, we will be using an embedding layer in the model for index representations. Since this is a learnable layer, it will be part of our model architecture and not pre-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating training data\n",
    "- When preparing text data, we need to break it into fixed-length sequences for training. Each sequence becomes a training example where we try to predict the next character. \n",
    "- Using a sliding window approach, we move through the text step by step. The sequence length (context window) is a key hyperparameter - too short and the model lacks context, too long and training becomes computationally intensive. For example, with text \"macbeth\" (context window=4):\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Window 1: \"macb\" → predict \"e\"\n",
    "  Window 2: \"acbe \" → predict \"t\"\n",
    "  Window 3: \"cbet\" → predict \"h\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Our input data is size (`NUM_SEQUENCES`, `SEQUENCE_LEN`), where `NUM_SEQUENCES` is the number of sequences of size `SEQUENCE_LEN` in the text\n",
