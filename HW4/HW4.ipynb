Machine learning models, especially large ones, can consume significant amounts of energy during training and inference, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Artificial intelligence, including large language models, is also a significant emitter of carbon <sup>[<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00529-w\">2</a>]</sup>.\n",

    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in an extra tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practitioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in an extra tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the extra tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probability of reaching a split on feature A in an extra tree trained on a dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on feature A will result in a high feature importance value for feature A. This could mean feature A is a very important feature for predicting the probability of the target label. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on feature B in an extra tree and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on feature B will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean feature B is not a very informative feature for predicting the target label. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.ExtraTreeClassifier to a dataset automatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the extra tree and stores these values in a **feature_importances\\_** variable.

    "### Simple Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the simplest form of recurrent neural networks. They are similar to feedforward networks, but have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing information from previous steps to influence the current processing step. This looping mechanism enables Simple RNNs to capture dependencies over time, which is especially useful for tasks involving language, where the context of earlier words or characters affects the final prediction.\n",
    "Here's how Simple RNNs generally work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At each timestep, the model:\n",
    "   - Takes in a new input\n",
    "   - Uses its current hidden state (memory of previous inputs)\n",
    "   - Produces both an output and an updated hidden state\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This process repeats for each element in the sequence, with the hidden state carrying information forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our character prediction task, we'll use a many-to-one configuration:\n",
    "- Input: We feed in characters one at a time (like \"m\", \"a\", \"c\", \"b\", \"e\")\n",
    "- Hidden State: Gets updated with each new character\n",
    "- Output: We only use the final prediction to guess the next character (\"t\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "![intro_to_rnn](data/images/intro_to_rnn.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple RNNs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem when performing backpropagation through time. This issue arises because the gradients are repeatedly multiplied by the weight matrix as they propagate through each time step. If the weights are small, these multiplications cause the gradients to decrease exponentially, effectively \"vanishing\" as they travel backward, while large weights can lead to gradient \"explosion.\" As a result, the network struggles to learn and retain long-term dependencies, meaning that early inputs in a sequence are gradually \"forgotten,\" and training becomes ineffective for tasks requiring the processing of lengthy sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed explanation of Simple RNNs and their limitations, see:\n",
    "- [An Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-network/)\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: Simple/Vanilla RNN and RNN are often used interchangeably since Simple RNNs represent the most basic implementation of RNNs. However, RNN is actually a broader term that encompasses any neural network model which incorporates hidden states and uses its previous outputs as inputs."

    "### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are an advanced type of recurrent neural network designed to better handle long sequences. Unlike Simple RNNs that have a single memory channel, LSTMs have two memory channels that allows the network to selectively remember or forget information over long sequences. \n",
    "At each timestep, an LSTM:\n",
    "   - Takes in a new input\n",
    "   - Uses two types of state:\n",
    "     * Cell State: Like a long-term memory that can preserve important information\n",
    "     * Hidden State: Like a working memory for immediate processing\n",
    "   - Uses three gates to control information flow:\n",
    "     * Forget gate: Decides what to remove from cell state\n",
    "     * Input gate: Decides what new information to store from the current input\n",
    "     * Output gate: Decides what parts of cell state to output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-memory system allows LSTMs to maintain important information for longer periods while still processing new inputs effectively. Think of it like reading a book while taking notes - the cell state is like your notebook where you write down important information, while the hidden state is like your immediate attention to the current word and its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architecture\n",
    "![intro_to_lstm](data/images/intro_to_lstm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our character prediction task, we'll use a many-to-one LSTM configuration:\n",
    "- Input: Characters fed in one at a time (like \"m\", \"a\", \"c\", \"b\", \"e\") as input\n",
    "- Output: Get the prediced next character (\"t\") using the last hidden state\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple RNNs struggle with long sequences because they try to pass all information through a single channel that gets increasingly noisy over time. LSTMs solve this by having two channels and specialized gates that allow the network to selectively update its memory state, rather than forcing all information through a single transformation. The memory cell pathway solves the vanishing gradient problem by providing a direct route for gradients to propagate backwards through time steps without being repeatedly multiplied by small numbers that would cause them to vanish. The gating mechanisms ensure this pathway remains relatively stable while still allowing the network to selectively update its memory when needed.\n",

    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loading the text\n",
    "- We'll use Shakespeare's Macbeth from Project Gutenberg\n",
    "- The text is first standardized by:\n",
    "  - Converting to lowercase for consistency\n",
    "  - Standardizing line endings and spacing\n",
    "- This standardized text is referred to as the 'corpus' - our primary dataset for training and inference\n",
    "- We vectorize the text by treating every character in our text as an individual unit (e.g., 'macbeth' -> ['m', 'a', 'c'...])\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Character-to-Index Mapping\n",
    "   - Neural networks can't process raw text, so we need to convert characters to numbers. \n",
    "   - First, we find all the unique characters in our text (including alphabets and special characters like spaces and punctuations). This forms our vocabulary, whose size we call the vocabulary size\n",
    "   - Each character in the vocabulary receives a unique integer assignment using the default ASCII value\n",
    "   - We use a dictionary to store this mapping: {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, ...}\n",
    "   - This mapping enables bidirectional conversion between characters and integers for model input and output interpretation\n",
    "   - We use this mapping to convert the vector of text into a vector of numerical values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "##### Index Representation\n",
    "   - You might be thinking that assigning numbers to letters based on alphabetical order seems rather arbitrary - and you'd be absolutely right! This is precisely why we need smarter index representations\n",
    "   - Using raw indices (like 1, 2, 3) implies an ordering and magnitude that doesn't exist\n",
    "   - For example, 'b' (2) is not \"twice as much\" as 'a' (1)\n",
    "   - We need a more sophisticated way to represent characters that avoids these misleading numerical relationships\n",
    "   \n",
    "      a) **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert index to binary vector\n",
    "        - Each index becomes a vector of zeros with a single 1 at the index of the character's value/index\n",
    "        - Example: \n",
    "          - index 1 ('a') → [0,1,0,0,...,0] (length 40)\n",
    "          - index 5 ('e') → [0,0,0,0,1,0,...,0] (length 40)\n",
    "        - Sparse (mostly zeros)\n",
    "        - No relationship between characters (both vowels 'a' and 'e' are completely different vectors)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      b) **Embeddings**: Convert index to learned dense vector\n",
    "        - Each character's index gets transformed into a list of numbers (a dense vector)\n",
    "        - Think of it like assigning each character a unique point a higher dimension coordinate plane\n",
    "        - The motivation is that we can position similar characters close to each other and transform discrete data like letters or words into a continous vector space that the model can use to make predictions from\n",
    "        - What makes embedding layers special is that they're learnable! The model figures out the best way to represent characters based on your specific data and task\n",
    "        - This is super useful since what makes characters \"similar\" changes between tasks - the model learns what similarity means for your specific case and groups characters accordingly\n",
    "        - The embedding layer's dimension parameter determines how many numbers we use to represent each character (the size of the vector space)\n",
    "        - Let's look at a real example with embedding dimension 4:\n",
    "          - The letter 'a' might become → [0.2, -0.5, 0.1, 0.8]\n",
    "          - The letter 'e' might become → [0.3, -0.4, 0.2, 0.7]\n",
    "        - In this example, model discovered that 'a' and 'e' are both vowels and represents them close to each other\n",
    "        - Additionally, embeddings are more memory efficient because they are dense (non-sparse) unlike one-hot vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For our model, we will be using an embedding layer in the model for index representations. Since this is a learnable layer, it will be part of our model architecture and not pre-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating training data\n",
    "- When preparing text data, we need to break it into fixed-length sequences for training. Each sequence becomes a training example where we try to predict the next character. \n",
    "- Using a sliding window approach, we move through the text step by step. The sequence length (context window) is a key hyperparameter - too short and the model lacks context, too long and training becomes computationally intensive. For example, with text \"macbeth\" (context window=4):\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Window 1: \"macb\" → predict \"e\"\n",
    "  Window 2: \"acbe \" → predict \"t\"\n",
    "  Window 3: \"cbet\" → predict \"h\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Our input data is size (`NUM_SEQUENCES`, `SEQUENCE_LEN`), where `NUM_SEQUENCES` is the number of sequences of size `SEQUENCE_LEN` in the text\n",
    "- Our target data is size (`NUM_SEQUENCES`, `1`) representing all the next characters for all sequences in the text\n",
    "- NOTE: While we show characters in the examples above for clarity, remember that the actual input and target data are numerical indices, not the characters themselves\n",
