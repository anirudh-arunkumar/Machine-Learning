    "\n",
    "You may use [his visualization tool](http://tech.nitoyon.com/en/blog/2013/11/07/k-means/) to refine your understanding of KMeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization: [5pts: 2pts + 3pts Bonus for Undergrad]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kmeans algorithm is sensitive to how the centers are initialized. The naive approach is to randomly initialize the centers. However, a bad initialization can increase the time required for convergence or may even converge to a non-optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **init_centers** [2pts]: Here you will initialize the centers randomly **(Required for all)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Please initialize centers by randomly sampling points (without repetition) from the data passed to the KMeans() object upon instantiation in case the autograder fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **kmpp_init** [3pts Bonus for Undergrad]: Here you will use the intuition that points further away from each other will probably be better initial centers by implementing a version of KMeans++ **(Bonus for Undergrad, required for Grads)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: We need to initialize the centers without repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### KMeans++\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for KMPP that you will implement can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample 1% of the points from the dataset, uniformly at random (UAR) and without replacement. This sample will be the dataset the remainder of the algorithm uses to minimize initialization overhead.\n",
    "2. From the above sample, select only one random point to be the first cluster center.\n",
    "3. For each point in the sampled dataset, find the nearest cluster center and record the squared distance to get there.\n",
    "4. Examine all the squared distances and take the point with the maximum squared distance as a new cluster center. In other words, we will choose the next center based on the maximum of the minimum calculated distance instead of sampling randomly like in step 2. You may break ties arbitrarily.\n",
    "5. Repeat 3-4 until all k-centers have been assigned. You may use a loop over K to keep track of the data in each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Cluster Assignments: [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've chosen your centers, you will need to update the membership of each point based on the closest center.\n",
    "You will implement this in **update_assignment**. See docstring for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Centers Assignments: [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since cluster memberships may have changed, you will need to update the cluster centers. You will implement this in **update_centers**. See docstring for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: You may use a loop over K to keep track of the data in each cluster. Avoid looping over N individual datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss & Convergence [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider KMeans to be converged when the change in loss drops below a threshold value. The loss will be\n",
    "defined as the sum of the squared distances between each point and its respective center.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train the model [10pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **train** method you will use all of the previously implemented steps to train your KMeans algorithm until convergence. Since the centers have already been initialized in the **init** function the general steps for the `train` method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update the cluster assignment for each point\n",
    "2. Update the cluster centers based on the new assignments from Step 1\n",
    "3. Check to make sure there is no [mean without a cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAU0gQXn28s), i.e. no cluster center without any points assigned to it.\n",
    "   - In the event of a cluster with no points assigned, pick a random point in the dataset to be the new center and update your cluster assignment accordingly.\n",
    "4. Calculate the loss and check if the model has converged to break the loop early.\n",
    "   - The convergence criteria is measured by whether the percentage of difference in loss with respect to the previous iteration's loss is less than the given relative tolerance threshold (self.rel_tol).\n",
    "5. Iterate through steps 1 to 4 max_iters times. **Make sure to avoid infinite looping.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided the following local tests to help you check your implementation. Provided unit-tests are meant as a guide and are not intended to be comprehensive. See [Using the Local Tests](#using_local_tests) for more details.\n"

    "Eco Emma, a nature enthusiast and budding data scientist from Green Earth University, is working on a series of eco-friendly posters for an environmental awareness campaign. With her digital resources as scarce as a rare bird sighting, Emma needs to simplify her color palette to reduce file sizes. Recalling her Machine Learning lessons, she knows that KMeans clustering can help distill her vibrant nature images into a more streamlined color palette. Your mission is to assist Emma in transforming this lush forest scene into a minimalist beauty using KMeans to find the optimal palette.\n",

    "We go about this by, choosing an arbitary point (x,y). Then we use the density formula function $f(x_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi(k) \\mathcal{N}(x_i | \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k)$ to find out what the density of points is at (x,y). Now that we have the density, we can draw a random number between 0 and the maximum density to determine if we will keep or discard (x,y). If the random number drawn is less than the density, then (x,y) is our sample, otherwise we discard (x,y) and repeat. This method ensure that the samples we generate are proportional to the density predicted by our GMM at any given area.\n"

    "\n",
    "Learning to work with messy data is a hallmark of a well-rounded data scientist. In most real-world settings the data given will usually have some issue, so it is important to learn skills to work around such impasses. This part of the assignment looks to expose you to clever ways to fix data using concepts that you have already learned in the prior questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! you recently graduated with your shiny GT degree. You've decided to pursue your childhood dream to study astrophysics. Stationed at a cutting edge Gamma Ray Telescope facility as a Data Scientist, delving into the high-energy physics of the universe, your mission is to probe the enigmatic Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, using a telescope that views the cosmos through gamma rays emitted by the most cataclysmic events in space like neutron star mergers, pulsars, and the voracious accretion disks of black holes. SUPER EXCITING!\n",
    "\n",
    "The cutting edge telescope you are working with detects these really high energy gamma ray emissions from really small windows in the sky. You find that the telescope can be configured with a few parameters to detect these particles. These parameters, 10 in number, range from the telescope's orientation and timing precision to the sensitivity settings that find the faintest gamma signals against the cosmic background.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, your cosmic quest faces an unexpected challenge. A data corruption incident has left a 15% void across your dataset, affecting both the intricate telescope parameters and the critical gamma ray detection records. This isn't just a minor hiccup; it's a significant obstacle in your path to unraveling the mysteries of our galaxy's heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a silver lining. You remember that the machine learning techniques learnt in CS4641/7641 are the key to navigating this data loss issue. This challenge transforms into an opportunity to showcase the resilience and ingenuity of data science in the face of adversity. How will you leverage your skills to reconstruct the missing pieces and ensure that your exploration of Sagittarius A* yields groundbreaking insights into the universe's most profound secrets?\n",

    "Clean the data and implement a semi-supervised learning framework to classify the detection of gamma rays for your experiments.
