    "#### Initialization: [5pts: 2pts + 3pts Bonus for Undergrad]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **init_centers** [2pts]: Here you will initialize the centers randomly **(Required for all)**\n",

    "1. Sample 1% of the points from the dataset, uniformly at random (UAR) and without replacement. This sample will be the dataset the remainder of the algorithm uses to minimize initialization overhead.\n",

    "3. For each point in the sampled dataset, find the nearest cluster center and record the squared distance to get there.\n",

In other words, we will choose the next center based on the maximum of the minimum calculated distance instead of sampling randomly like in step 2. You may break ties arbitrarily.\n",

    "After you've chosen your centers, you will need to update the membership of each point based on the closest center.\n",
    "You will implement this in **update_assignment**. See docstring for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Centers Assignments: [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since cluster memberships may have changed, you will need to update the cluster centers. You will implement this in **update_centers**. See docstring for more details.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Train the model [10pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **train** method you will use all of the previously implemented steps to train your KMeans algorithm until convergence. Since the centers have already been initialized in the **init** function the general steps for the `train` method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update the cluster assignment for each point\n",
    "2. Update the cluster centers based on the new assignments from Step 1\n",
    "3. Check to make sure there is no [mean without a cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAU0gQXn28s), i.e. no cluster center without any points assigned to it.\n",
    "   - In the event of a cluster with no points assigned, pick a random point in the dataset to be the new center and update your cluster assignment accordingly.\n",
    "4. Calculate the loss and check if the model has converged to break the loop early.\n",
    "   - The convergence criteria is measured by whether the percentage of difference in loss with respect to the previous iteration's loss is less than the given relative tolerance threshold (self.rel_tol).\n",

    "- First, to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian Mixture, you'll need to fit your GMM implementation to the dataset. You need to specify K=4 to represent 4 gaussians in our model, and run the EM algorithm. You'll have to choose the value for max_iters. If at the end of this section, your plot of the sampled datapoints doesn't look like the original distribution, you may need to increase max_iters to fit the GMM model better, and obtain better estimates of the parameters.\n",
    "- Once you heve the estimated parameters, we'll need to sample 1000 datapoints from the Gaussian Mixture. You will be using a technique called Rejection Sampling discussed below.

    "To generate points directly from a given distribution is done via Inverse transform sampling. In inverse transform sampling, we require taking the inverse of cummulative distribution function for our gaussian mixture model. This operation in general can be expensive unless there is some known formula for inverting the CDF. It is also not always possible to take the inverse of the CDF of a gaussian mixture model. For these reasons we will implement a sampling method instead. This sampling method will give us points matching the gmm without the computation and mathematical concerns of generation.\n",

    "**Rejection Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally we think of Gaussian Mixture Models as a form of soft clustering, but you can also think of them as an algorithm for estimating density of data points with gaussians. Thus we can take an arbitary data point and using the gaussian mixture model as an estimation for the density at a given location. From here we want the points that we sample to be proportional to the density at a given location.\n",
    "\n",
    "We go about this by, choosing an arbitary point (x,y). Then we use the density formula function $f(x_i) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi(k) \\mathcal{N}(x_i | \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k)$ to find out what the density of points is at (x,y). Now that we have the density, we can draw a random number between 0 and the maximum density to determine if we will keep or discard (x,y). If the random number drawn is less than the density, then (x,y) is our sample, otherwise we discard (x,y) and repeat. This method ensure that the samples we generate are proportional to the density predicted by our GMM at any given area.\n"

In most real-world settings the data given will usually have some issue, so it is important to learn skills to work around such impasses.

Stationed at a cutting edge Gamma Ray Telescope facility as a Data Scientist, delving into the high-energy physics of the universe, your mission is to probe the enigmatic Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, using a telescope that views the cosmos through gamma rays emitted by the most cataclysmic events in space like neutron star mergers, pulsars, and the voracious accretion disks of black holes. SUPER EXCITING!\n",

A data corruption incident has left a 15% void across your dataset, affecting both the intricate telescope parameters and the critical gamma ray detection records.
